# Sorting algorithms
This repository contains implementations of algorithms in C++, created as part of the project for the Design and analysis of algorithms course at the Wrocław University of Science and Technology. The goal of the project is to analyze the performance and complexity of various algorithmic approaches through practical coding exercises.

## Implemented algorithms
- quicksort
- mergesort
- introsort
  
## Project Overview
This project includes an interactive menu allowing users to select a sorting algorithm, choose the array size and specify the array’s pre-sortedness level. 
Each algorithm was tested under different pre-sorting conditions such as completely random arrays, arrays with 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%, 99%, and 99.7% of elements pre-sorted, and fully sorted array in reverse order.
Tests were performed on arrays of eight different sizes.
